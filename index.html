              <p>
                The hyrax is also called rock rabbit or dassie, is a small furry
                mammal. It looks like a robust, oversized guinea pig, or a
                rabbit with rounded ears and no tail. Hyraxes have stumpy toes
                with hoof-like nails; and four toes on each front foot and three
                on each back foot. The longer, claw-like nails on the inside
                toes and the back feet are used for grooming and scratching. The
                bottoms of the feet have a rubbery texture to assist in climbing
                steep rock surfaces and trees. Of the three hyrax species, two
                are known as rock (or bush) hyrax, and the third as tree hyrax.
                In the field, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate among
                them. The rock hyrax has the widest distribution in East Africa.
                Its coat is yellowish — or grayish-brown — and the dorsal spot
                (a bare scent gland on the back covered with longer hair) is
                covered with black or yellow hair. Its head is more rounded than
                other types of hyraxes, and the nose is blunt. The
                yellow-spotted hyrax, or rock rabbit, is smaller in size and has
                a more pointed, rodent-like nose. Generally, it has a
                conspicuous white patch over the eye, and its dorsal spot is
                whitish or yellowish. It is sometimes seen in the company of
                other types of hyrax, but species do not interbreed. Tree
                hyraxes, unsurprisingly, spend a lot of time in trees. In some
                areas, they are hunted for their thick, soft, long hair. They
                have a white or yellow dorsal spot.

                Hyraxes have taken part of the internet by storm. Characterized
                by their nature call, - <strong>AWAWA</strong> , hyraxes are
                adorable creatures that some jokingly call 'evil creatures' due
                to their vampire-like fangs!

              <h1>Where do hyraxes live?</h1>
              <p>
                Hyraxes have a life span of 9 to 14 years. Both types of "rock"
                hyrax (P. capensis and H. brucei) live on rock outcrops,
                including cliffs in Ethiopia[4] and isolated granite outcrops
                called koppies in southern Africa.[5] Almost all hyraxes are
                limited to Africa; the exception is the rock hyrax (P. capensis)
                which is also found in adjacent parts of the Middle East.
                Hyraxes were a much more diverse group in the past encompassing
                species considerably larger than modern hyraxes. The largest
                known extinct hyrax, Titanohyrax ultimus, has been estimated to
                weigh 600–1,300 kilograms (1,300–2,900 lb), comparable to a
                rhinoceros.[6]

              <h1>What do hyraxes eat?</h1>
              <p>
                Hyraxes are mostly herbivores that eat grasses, fruits, leaves,
                roots, and bark. Their diet varies by species and season, with
                some hyraxes also consuming flowers, buds, and occasionally
                insects, lizards, or bird eggs. Tree hyraxes, for example,
                primarily eat leaves, twigs, and fruit, while rock hyraxes
                consume a broader range of plants, including grasses, and may
                even develop a taste for garden plants. Here's a breakdown of
                their diet: Grasses and Herbage: In the wet season, hyraxes,
                especially rock hyraxes, eat a large amount of grass. Fruits and
                Leaves: During dry periods, they switch to a more diverse diet
                of leaves and fruits. Other Plant Matter: Their diet also
                includes twigs, bark, roots, and bulbs. Insects and Eggs: Some
                species, like the rock hyrax, will occasionally eat insects,
                lizards, and bird eggs for additional nutrition
